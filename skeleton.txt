I will be documenting my general notes  and thought process about this project here
I am making a budget tracker app (Must include name)
I am must also include purpose
Make this txt file prettier
Should i work with only one currency? or just numbers 
Should my app prompt the user a lot of times?
Should i include a welcome message ?

Some of the required features include:
• Add income and expense entries 
• View a summary of total income, expenses, and balance 
• Save and load transactions from a file 
• Search for a specific transaction by date or keyword 

My app will be ideal for a user with a monthly income
The expense entries will include:
• Tax bracket- I will use the percentage given to deduct the taxes. #
             - Should only be in percentage form (error checking)
• Fixed expenses- They include rent, electricity, waterbills, monthly shopping, fuel #
                - I should ask the user if they have this fixed expenses and any other
• Daily spendings- They include food, transport and emergency money, all these is input from the user

From the data given,i should be able to return a summary of:
• Total income
• Tax deducted
• Total amount of fixed expenses
• Total amount of daily spendings per month
• balance

From the balance, I will ask the user if they may be interested in a budgeting plan in order to save money
I will be using two methods as it is much simpler
Budgeting plans include:
• 50/30/20 rule - 50% of income goes to fixed expenses, 30% to variable expenses and daily spendings and 20% to savings 
• Custom threshold - Where the user get to say how much to save.
                   - There are 3 cases: 1.fixed (eg I want to save 20dollars)
                                        2.income percentage (eg I want to save 15% of my income)
                                        3.disposable percentage (eg i want to save 5% of whats left after expenses)
Depending on the budgeting plan, the app should return the savings for that month

Since we will be saving and loading transactions, we will be saving files per month
What is being saved in files:
• a detailed summary of income and expenses including if the user pays rent and such
• budgeting plan the user choose and what it entails 
• monthly savings

I am unsure of how i will search transcations by date...by keyword seems easier

An additional feature i might have is to predict how much the user can save annually
Maybe also give a review on the savings, if they did a good job or if they need to improve 

The following Core Python Concepts must be utilized in my app
• Variables & Data Types (strings, integers, floats, booleans) 
• Operators (arithmetic, comparison, logical) 
• Control Flow (if/elif/else, for and while loops) 
• Functions (with parameters and return values) 
• Data Structures: Lists, Dictionaries, Sets, Tuples 
• File I/O: Read from and write to text files (for saving user data) 
• Error Handling: Use try/except to handle user input errors or file issues

can i write different python scripts
